/** @brief Median Flow tracker implementation.

Implementation of a paper @cite MedianFlow .

The tracker is suitable for very smooth and predictable movements when object is visible throughout
the whole sequence. It's quite and accurate for this type of problems (in particular, it was shown
by authors to outperform MIL). During the implementation period the code at
<http://www.aonsquared.co.uk/node/5>, the courtesy of the author Arthur Amarra, was used for the
reference purpose.
